spinlocks:
    - good spinlocks with debugging info
    - use them where appropriate

cleanup:
    - remove identity mapping
    - unmap unecessary zones
    - cleanup boot code

AOC for kernel:
    - write a simple memory manager (a stack) for managing large arrays of objects (structs)
      this will probably use macros and typeof

CPUID:
    - give detailed cpu information

Interrupts:
    - get lapic base from msr if madt doesn't exist
    - make sure LAPIC/IOAPIC code is good
    - interrupt priorities (TPR, lowest priority...)
    - scheduling

PMM:
    - use zones for DMA

SSE:
    - optimized memory functions
    - context switching (save and restore XMM registers if necessary)

DMA
CMOS
RTC
HPET

drivers:
    - enumerate pci devices
    - ps2 controller driver
    - keyboard driver
    - mouse driver
